### 👋 About Me
Hi, I'm Enrico Garozzo – but you might know me as **KobolMan**!  

I'm an engineer who thrives at the intersection of hardware and software, specializing in embedded systems and automation solutions. From designing PCBs for tiny microcontrollers to programming complex industrial automation systems, I love the challenge of making different technologies work seamlessly together.

My passion lies in transforming abstract concepts into tangible, working systems – whether it's developing real-time control algorithms, optimizing communication protocols, or prototyping the next iteration of a drone flight controller. I believe the best solutions come from understanding both the theoretical foundations and the practical constraints, which is why I enjoy getting hands-on with everything from system requirements analysis, system architecture to welding steel frames!

Always excited for new challenges and happy to get my hands dirty turning ideas into reality!
