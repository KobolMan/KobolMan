👋 About Me
Hi, I'm Enrico Garozzo – but you might know me as KobolMan!
I'm an engineer who thrives at the intersection of hardware and software, specializing in embedded systems and automation solutions. From designing PCBs for tiny microcontrollers to programming complex industrial automation systems, I love the challenge of making different technologies work seamlessly together.
My passion lies in transforming abstract concepts into tangible, working systems – whether it's developing real-time control algorithms, optimizing communication protocols, or prototyping the next iteration of a drone flight controller. I believe the best solutions come from understanding both the theoretical foundations and the practical constraints, which is why I enjoy getting hands-on with everything from system requirements analysis, system architecture to welding steel frames!
Always excited for new challenges and happy to get my hands dirty turning ideas into reality!
